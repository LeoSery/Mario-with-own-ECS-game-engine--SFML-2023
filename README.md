## Presentation :

In this project, the goal was to **create a game in C++ without using a game engine** and with a very **specific project architecture**. We developed our **own engine with an ECS** (*Entity Component System*) architecture. Then we **made a Mario game** to demonstrate **how our engine works**. 

## Game keys :

- *Movement*:
    - Move to the left: **Q** or **Left arrow**
    - Move to the right: **D** or **Right arrow**
    - Jump **Z** or **Up arrow**

## Main mechanics : 


You can **move** your character using the buttons above, but your aim is to **reach to the end of the level** by **dodging enemies and avoiding traps**.

You can **kill enemies by jumping on them**. Be careful, though, **if he touches you, you'll die** and have to **restart the level**.
